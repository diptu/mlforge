## Overview

Machine Learning (ML) is a foundational concept in modern Artificial Intelligence. It enables systems to automatically learn patterns from data and improve performance over time—making it essential for building intelligent, scalable applications.

---

## Core Concept

[**Machine learning**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building algorithms capable of **learning from data**.

Instead of relying on hard-coded rules, machine learning models:
- Analyze historical (training) data  
- Identify meaningful patterns  
- Use those patterns to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data  

### Why Machine Learning Matters

Machine learning powers many real-world systems, including:
- Search engines and recommendation systems  
- Fraud detection and risk analysis  
- Speech recognition and language translation  
- Image and video understanding  

Its ability to scale with growing data makes ML a core technology in today’s data-driven world.

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ Machine Learning is a **subset of Artificial Intelligence**
- ✅ ML systems learn from **data**, not explicit rules
- ✅ Models can **generalize** to unseen data
- ✅ Performance improves as more data becomes available
