## Overview

The terms **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** are often used interchangeably, which leads to confusion—especially for beginners. Understanding the distinction early helps build a strong conceptual foundation for deeper ML and DL topics.

---

## Core Concept

### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence refers to systems designed to **simulate human intelligence** and decision-making.

**Key characteristics of AI:**
- Mimics human reasoning and problem-solving
- Aims to perform complex tasks such as planning and decision-making
- Works with **structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data**
- Uses rules, logic, decision trees, and learning-based methods
- Has a **broad scope of applications** (chatbots, robotics, expert systems)

### What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine Learning is a **subset of AI** that enables systems to **learn from historical data** and improve performance over time.

**Key characteristics of ML:**
- Learns patterns autonomously from data
- Focuses on **specific tasks** like prediction and classification
- Uses statistical and mathematical models
- Relies mostly on **structured and semi-structured data**
- Improves accuracy as more data becomes available

### AI vs ML: Key Differences

| Aspect | Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Machine Learning (ML) |
|------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Scope | Broad concept | Subset of AI |
| Goal | Mimic human intelligence | Learn patterns from data |
| Learning | Optional | Mandatory |
| Data Types | Structured, semi-structured, unstructured | Mostly structured & semi-structured |
| Techniques | Rules, logic, decision trees, ML | Statistical & learning algorithms |
| Flexibility | Multi-purpose systems | Task-specific models |
