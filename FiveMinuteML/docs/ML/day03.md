## Overview

Not all Machine Learning problems are the same.  
Depending on **how data is labeled** and **how learning happens**, Machine Learning is commonly divided into three main types:
**Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning**.

Understanding these categories helps you quickly identify **which approach fits a problem**.

## Core Concept

### 1️⃣ Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning works with **labeled data**, meaning the correct output is already known.

**Key characteristics:**
- Input–output pairs are provided
- Model learns a mapping from inputs to outputs
- Most commonly used ML paradigm

**Common tasks:**
- Classification (spam detection, disease prediction)
- Regression (price prediction, demand forecasting)

**Examples:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- k-NN

---

### 2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning works with **unlabeled data**, where no correct output is given.

**Key characteristics:**
- Discovers hidden patterns or structure
- No predefined labels
- Often used for data exploration

**Common tasks:**
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction
- Anomaly detection

**Examples:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

---

### 3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is based on **learning through interaction** with an environment.

**Key characteristics:**
- No labeled dataset
- Learns via rewards and penalties
- Focuses on sequential decision-making

**Common use cases:**
- Game playing (Chess, Go)
- Robotics
- Recommendation systems

**Examples:**
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods

---

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ Supervised Learning uses **labeled data**
- ✅ Unsupervised Learning finds patterns in **unlabeled data**
- ✅ Reinforcement Learning learns via **trial and reward**
- ✅ Problem type determines the ML approach
