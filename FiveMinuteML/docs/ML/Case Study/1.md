## Business Problem

Large e-commerce fashion catalogs offer users *many choices* but make it hard to discover **stylish, coordinated items**.

The goal of the **Complete the Look (CTL)** system is to:
- Generate **complete outfits** built around a single product the user is viewing  
- Provide **style-aware, personalized recommendations** rather than only “similar items”  
- Increase *conversion*, *engagement*, and *basket size* by forming multi-item outfit sets :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## High-Level Solution

Instead of recommending single complementary products, CTL aims to recommend **cohesive sets of items** that work well together — e.g., an outfit composed of shirts, pants, jackets, and accessories that match stylistically and contextually.

Key objectives:
- Improve product discovery by offering complete looks
- Build user confidence in outfit choices
- Encourage users to add multiple items to their cart :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

The system combines complementary recommendations with style compatibility and visual similarity to form cohesive looks.

## System Components

### 1. Candidate Selection  
Start with complementary item recommendations using signals like:
- Co-purchase and co-view histories
- Engagement metrics  
Apply filters such as:
- Gender/age suitability
- Seasonal relevance
- Blacklists (inappropriate items) 

### 2. Look Definition  
Defines an outfit as a combination of **super product types (SPTs)** — e.g., “tops”, “bottoms”, “outerwear” — instead of individual product types. This improves recall and reduces exponential combinations. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 3. Look Generation  
Combine multiple items from the selected candidate pool using complementary models to form basic outfits. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### 4. Outfit Style Matching  
Train *item style embeddings* using **triplet learning**:
- Anchor item  
- Positive item (style-compatible)  
- Negative item (style-incompatible)

Style similarity is computed from pretrained image embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and fed into a triplet network to produce a style compatibility score. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### 5. Variant Expansion  
Expand the generated look to *all available sizes and variants* of the anchor item to improve coverage. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## ML Modeling & Algorithms

### Style Embedding  
- Use **CLIP image embeddings** as the base representation  
- Train a **triplet network** to maximize similarity for compatible outfits and minimize it for unrelated styles  
- This captures subtle style preferences beyond simple co-occurrence :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### Ranking  
Final look ranking uses a **weighted scoring system** combining:
- Style similarity
- Brand affinity
- Price proximity  
Weights are adjusted using user interaction data. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Feedback & Model Improvement

User interaction signals (impressions, clicks, add-to-cart, purchases) are fed back into the system to:
- Adjust look definitions
- Improve style embedding training
- Refine ranking parameters

This forms a **continuous learning loop** to improve recommendations over time. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Key Takeaways

- 🎯 CTL moves *beyond simple recommenders* to generate **cohesive multi-item outfits**
- 🧠 Uses **embedding-based style similarity** to capture fashion compatibility
- 📊 Feedback signals improve model quality via retraining and weight adjustments
- 📈 Outcome: enhanced discovery, higher confidence, and increased basket size ✨
